            <h2>Work Management on SQL Server Reporting Services</h2>
            <p class="article-meta">Published on: June 17, 2024</p>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>The project aimed to develop a centerline reporting system using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to replace the existing Excel-based reporting system. This initiative addressed significant maintenance challenges and inefficiencies by providing a centralized and streamlined reporting platform accessible through a web portal.</p>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Reports: </strong>Users can filter and drill down into details within the reports.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Data: </strong>Reports display current data from an on-premises SQL Server database.</li>
                <li><strong>User Personalization: </strong>The web portal customizes the display of reports and KPIs based on user IDs.</li>
                <li><strong>Centralized Access: </strong>A single access point for all reports and KPIs enhances user experience and accessibility.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Architecture: </strong>The architecture includes an on-premises SQL Server for data storage, with ETL processes managed through SQL queries, ensuring real-time data availability in SSRS reports.</li>
                <li><strong>SSRS Configuration: </strong>The SSRS web portal hosts and manages the reports, providing a directory for file uploads and user access.</li>
                <li><strong>ETL Process: </strong>Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) are performed using SQL queries to maintain data integrity and freshness.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The SSRS-based work management system significantly improved operational efficiency by centralizing reporting, reducing maintenance efforts, and providing real-time, personalized access to data. The project enhanced the company's ability to make data-driven decisions and received positive feedback for its usability and impact. Future enhancements will focus on integrating advanced analytics, supporting mobile access, and expanding the range of reports and KPIs.</p>
